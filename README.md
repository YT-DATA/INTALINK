#### Core Capabilities include:
- **Automatic Inter-table Relationship Generation**: Automatically detects and constructs relationships between two data tables, building a global data table topology based on foundational inter-table relationships.
- **Automatic Query Statement Construction**: Users specify the needed data items, and the software generates the correct SQL query statements, intelligently incorporating intermediate tables for data association, thus avoiding the complexity of manual writing.
- **Data Linkage Optimization Analysis**: Evaluates data linkage quality from multiple pathways, angles, and methods, and intelligently recommends optimized data query methods.
- **Lowering Technical Barriers**: Reduces the need for data developers to engage in extensive business research and data resource organization, and decreases the workload for data operations personnel.
- **Enhanced Data Governance**: Assists data managers in quickly identifying issues and making decisions, especially in dealing with data silo problems.
- **Functionality Enhancement**: Upgrades existing software features, such as transforming manual analyses in BI tools into intelligent analyses, and automating data migration and query functions.
